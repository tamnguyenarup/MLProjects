# **Heart Disease Predictive Analytics**
**Objective**: Understanding the main contributors to heart disease and building a predictive model that can effectively detect a person’s propensity of having heart disease

**Dataset Description**: The dataset source is from a 2020 annual CDC survey data of 400k adults related to their health status, and contains the variable “HeartDisease” which indicates if a respondent had heart disease. In addition, variables indicating the health status/lifestyle habits of respondents are included.

**Modelling Approach**: We intend to structure the problem as a Supervised Classification problem where we predict on the label “HeartDisease” (indicating whether a person will/will not contract heart disease)

**Stages of our analysis**
1. Data Cleaning (understanding features and datatypes, handling missing values, data impute)
2. Feature Engineering
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations, correlations etc.)
4. Data Preprocessing for ML (train test splits, scaling, encoding, PCA, oversampling)
5. Modeling (Model Training, Hyperparameter Tuning, Feature Importance etc.)
